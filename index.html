    				<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
      				<p>Marketing, its a common factor in our every day life. But has marketing gotten so constant that you don’t even notice anymore? Between email ads, promoted social posts, banner ads and more, almost every time we are on the internet we are bound to see a brand pushing its message or products on us. 
					With all these ads, consumers are often faced with what is considered “clutter.” They see so many ads every day that they tune them out, making it harder for marketers to push through and stand out.
					I decided to test this theory out, was I really tuning out online ads, and if not how many was I truly interacting with everyday.</p>
